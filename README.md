# DarbAI-API-Endpoint

## Overview

This Repo serves as a API endpoint for two features in our DarbAI Project. 
1. The first feature is the **personalized trip planner feature**: which is used to plan a trip for the user based on their preferences.
2. The second feature is the **landmark recognition feature**: which is used to identify landmarks in Saudi Arabia and provide information about them.

## API and Deployment

The landmark recognition model and 
the trip planner model are both accessible through a simple REST API built with FastAPI. It's hosted on Railway. For more details, check out our [API Docs](https://fastapi-production-c2d8.up.railway.app/docs).

## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How to use

- Clone locally and install packages with pip using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run locally using `hypercorn main:app --reload`
- you can now access the API at `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- you can acces the landmark recognition feature at `http://localhost:8000/landmark`
- but you can't access the trip planner feature locally because it requires a database connection which is not available locally
